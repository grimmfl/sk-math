# sk-math

A simple WIP math language with its own interpreter written in Python.

## Usage

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Write code in editor    | python main.py                  |
| Compile code from file  | python main.py -f \<FILENAME\>  |
| Help                    | python main.py -h               |

#### Editor
I know it sucks but it will get better :D

F10 to compile the written code

- Arrays
- Variable Declarations and Assignments
- Function Definitions and Calls
- If Statements
- For Loops
- Outputs

## Documentation

#### Statements
Statements build the base structure of your code.

A statement can be one of the following:
- Variable Declaration / Assignment
- Function Declaration
- Function Call
- Output
- If Statements
- For Loops

A new line ends a statement and starts a new one

#### Expressions
An expression can be one of the following:
- ```5``` Constant
- ```x``` Variable
- ```foo(x, 1)``` Function Call
- ```(5 * (x + foo(x, 1))) ^ 2``` Arithmetic Expression
- ```x < 5 && y == 27 + 3 || !false``` Boolean Expression

#### Operator Precedences
|   | Symbol          | Operator                          |
| - | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1 | - !             | Unary Minus, Logical Not          |
| 2 | * / %           | Multiplication, Division, Modulo  |
| 3 | + -             | Addition, Subtraction             |
| 4 | == != <= >= < > | Comparisons                       |
| 5 | &&              | Logical and                       |
| 6 | \|\|            | Logical or                        |

You can use parentheses to work around those precedences.

#### If Statements
```java
if (x < 5) {
    int y = 3 + 2
    z = y * 7
}
```

The condition needs to be of type ```bool```.

The body needs to start with ```{``` followed by a newline and end with a newline followed by ```}```.

```java
if (x < 5) {
    int y = 3 + 2
    z = y * 7
} elif (x < 7) {
    z = z + 7
} elif (x == 7) {
    x = 0
} else {
    z = 2
}
```

If Statements can have multiple ```elif``` blocks and one ```else``` block. The ```elif``` and ```else``` keywords needs to be after the closing ```}``` without a newline.

The body needs to start with ```{``` followed by a newline and end with a newline followed by ```}```.

If Statements can be nested.

#### While Loops
```java
int i
i = 0
while (i < 10) {
    out i
    i = i + 1
}
```

The condition needs to be surrounded by parentheses and of type Bool.

The body needs to start with ```{``` followed by a newline and end with a newline followed by ```}```.

#### For Loops
```java
int[5] a
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for (int i in a) {
    out i * 3
}
```

For Statements are used like this:
1. Choose the type of the iterator element: ```int```
2. Choose a name for the iterator element: ```i```
3. ```in``` keyword
4. Reference the array you want to iterate over. The element type of the array has to be the same as the chosen element type: ```a```

The body needs to start with ```{``` followed by a newline and end with a newline followed by ```}```.

You can also create a classic for loop, by using the predefined ```range``` function:
```java
for (int i in range(0, 10) {
    out i
}
```

#### Variable Declaration
- Single Variable Declaration: ```int x```
- Multiple Variable Declaration: ```float x, y, z```

Variables can not be declared more than once in a scope.

#### Variable Assignment
- Constant Assignment: ```x = true```
- Variable Assignment: ```y = 3.0 * x + 4.6```

Variables need to be declared before a value can be assigned to them.
If the variable is declared as ```float``` the value needs to be a float too. ```4``` is not a float value.

#### Arrays
Array Declaration: ```int[4] testArray1, testArray2```

You can declare arrays by naming the element type, followed by the size of the array surrounded by squared brackets.

Array Assignments:

There are different kinds of assignments:
- Array Assignment: ```testArray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]```
- Element Assignment: ```testArray2[0] = 10```

- You can also use array elements in an expression: ```testArray1[2] + 25```
- Or you can use the whole array as an expression: ```out testArray1```
- You can also select a sub array from an array: ```a[3:]```, ```a[:2]```, ```a[3:5]``` (from inclusive, to exclusive)


#### Function Definition
```java
func int foo(int x, int y, int z) {
  int a = x + y
  return a * z
}
```

Functions start a new scope.

The ```func``` keyword is followed by the return type of the function.

Parameters are separated with a ```,``` and need to have a type.

The body needs to start with ```{``` followed by a newline and end with a newline followed by ```}```.

If a function has a return type, it needs to return a value of that type.

If your functions does not return anything, you can use ```void``` as the return type:

```java
func void bar(int x) {
    out x + 5
}
```

Functions can also contain optional parameters by defining a default value:

```java
func void bar(int x, int y = 10) {
    out x + y
}
```

Optional parameters need to be defined after all required parameters.

#### Predefined Functions

The following functions are already implemented:

```func float sqrt(float x)``` calculates the square root of a float x

```func float intToFloat(int x)``` casts an integer to a float

```func int floatToInt(float x)``` casts a float to an integer

```func int[] range(int from, int to, int step = 1)``` returns an int[to - from] filled with from ```from``` to ```to``` with step ```step

#### Function Calls
Function calls can be used as statements:

```java
foo(1, y, 3)
```

or  as expressions:

```java
x = foo(1, y, 3) + z
```

The actual parameters can be expressions and need to match the formal parameters of the function definition in count and type.

#### Outputs
```java
out 5
```

```java
out 7 + bar(1) * a
```

Outputs always need to be an expression.

## Grammar (CFG)

- IfStatement ::= 'if' '(' Expr ')' '{' Body '}' ElifStatement* (ElseStatement | Ɛ)
- ElifStatement ::= 'elif' '(' Expr ')' '{' Body '}'
- ElseStatement ::= 'else' '{' Body '}'
- ReturnStatement ::= 'return' Expr
- VarDecl ::= Type ID (',' ID)*
- VarAssign ::= (ID '=' Expr) | ArrayElementAssign
- ArrayElementAssign ::= ID '\[' Expr '\]' = Expr
- Out ::= 'out' Expr
- Expr ::= Or
- Or ::= And ( '||' And )*
- And ::= Comparison ( '&&' Comparison)*
- Comparison ::= AddSub (Ɛ | (ComparisonOp AddSub))
- ComparisonOp ::= '==' | '!=' | '<=' | '>=' | '<' | '>'
- AddSub ::= MulDiv ( ( '+' | '-' ) MulDiv )*
- MulDiv ::= Exponentiation ( ( '\*' | '/' ) Exponentiation )*
- Exponentiation ::= Atom ( '^' Atom )*
- Type ::= ('int' | 'float' | 'bool') (Ɛ | '\[' Expr '\]')
- Atom ::= INT | FLOAT | ID | FuncCall | 'true' | 'false' | Array | ArrayElementSelection 
- Array ::= '\[' (Ɛ | (Expr (',' Expr)*)) '\]'
- ArrayElementSelection ::= ID '\[' (Expr | ArraySubSelection) '\]'
- ArraySubSelection ::= (Expr ':') | (':' Expr) | (Expr ':' Expr)
